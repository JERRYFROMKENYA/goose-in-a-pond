//! Background memory extraction over every stored conversation; must never block the chat stream.

//! This is the write gate: adapters are not trusted to enforce their prompt (a 4B model ignores

//! dedup here. A dedup match is dropped, not reinforced, and recorded with the id it lost to.
//!
//! On a multi-member pond an unidentified conversation (every voice-child one included) is never
//! mined, only counted in [`PassReport::sessions_unnameable`]: misfiling is worse than losing it.
